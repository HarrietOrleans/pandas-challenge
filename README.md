Written report is below with the data that I have so far.

I was interesting to see that per student budget does not always correlate to higher scores on reading and writing. For example, Cabrera High School has a per student budget of $582.00 one of the lowest, but their overall passing rate is 91.33% which is the highest rate. Huang High School, which spends the most per student has one of the lowest passing rates.
In regards to math scores by grade, it looks like the grades stay steady throughout the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades. Pena High School had the highest average math score and Figueroa High School had the lowest.

Average reading scores across the schools were similar. There does seem to be some correlation between average math scores and average reading scores. For example, Bailey High School which has an average math score of 77.05% also has one of the lower average reading score of 81.03%
